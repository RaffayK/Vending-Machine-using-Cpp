## Chapter 1: Introduction

### 1.1 Project Description

The Vending Machine project is a computerized system to manage product sales, such as product availability, pricing, and payments. It aims to increase efficiency, reduce errors, and save time and costs. Designed for small-scale shops, the system automates the item purchasing process, allowing customers to buy items and pay with cash, simplifying the payment process and reducing paperwork and manpower.

### 1.2 Scope of the Project

The system is designed for both admin and user functionalities:
- **Admin Management:** Manage and maintain the system, update user access.
- **User Facilities:** Check item availability, purchase items, receive correct change, and experience a user-friendly interface.

### 1.3 Modules in Project

- **Machine Module:** Manage product details.
- **Item Module:** Manage item specifics.
- **Company Management Module:** Handle company information.
- **Sales Module:** Track sales details.
- **Product Module:** Manage product inventory.
- **Login Module:** Secure admin login.

### 1.4 Project Features

- High accuracy
- Simple and easy menu configuration
- User-friendly management
- Speedy operations
- Accessible for everyone to buy products

## Chapter 2: Requirements Specification

### 2.1 Software Requirements

- Visual Studio

## Chapter 3: Analysis

### 3.1 Existing System

Current systems display item lists and have password-protected admin login but lack hardware integration, leading to potential virus issues and manual involvement in transactions.

### 3.2 Proposed System

The proposed system integrates software with hardware to enable automated transactions without shopkeeper involvement, providing a seamless customer experience.

## Chapter 4: System Implementation

### 4.1 Introduction

The goal is to enhance item purchasing efficiency and minimize human errors. The system, developed as a desktop/web application in C++, automates vending machine operations. Admins can add or review items, while users can select and purchase items, with the system managing the transaction process and change calculation.
